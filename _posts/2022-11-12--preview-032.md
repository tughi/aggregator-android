### Important changes:

- Target SDK 33
- Request permission to post notifications
- Clear state of changed feed to refresh it on next update

### F-Droid

Aggregator is available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tughi.aggregator/) now.

On F-Droid, Aggregator uses the same ID as the old (unsupported) application on Google Play. This
means you cannot have both the old version from Google Play and the new version from F-Droid
installed on one device at the same time.

The old application on Google Play will be replaced soon to be in sync with F-Droid.
